Abstract: 
  SLE is a complex autoimmune disease and its cause is unclear. Given the autoimmune nature of SLE and the newly-recognized    
  role of intron retention (IR) played in global gene regulation, we studied the global gene expression and intron retention
  pattern of lupus patients. 
  The top principal component of global IR pattern provide insight into lupus evaluation and diagnosis, while the dominant
  genes in the component may serve as biomarkers and show potential for drug design or treatment of SLE.
