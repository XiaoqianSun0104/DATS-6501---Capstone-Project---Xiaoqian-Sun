  T Cell Global Intron Retention Describes patient subtypes in Systemic lupus erythematousus

Data Availability Statement: 
  The raw data have been deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under Bioproject Accession ID PRJNA293549.

Abstract: 
  SLE is a complex autoimmune disease and its cause is unclear. Given the autoimmune nature of SLE and the newly-recognized    
  role of intron retention (IR) played in global gene regulation, we studied the global gene expression and intron retention
  pattern of lupus patients.
